# This is 3rd Task for Delta Club (NIT-Trichy)

# in this project I have used React, NodeJs and MongoDb  

This is my latest code  for Task 3 of the Delta Inductions 2024 (Web development).


# SetUp

1. Clone the Repository 
 
 Clone the main Branch of this Repository.

2. I have used MongoDb Atlas (Link is already Applied in the code)

# I haven't set any private file for ease purpose 
  so need need for setting Env file 


3. for seting up Backend 
  a. run "cd backend"  in terminal
  b. "npm install"
  c. "nodemon"
  this will start local host 4000 

4. For setting up frontend File 
   a. run "cd ../front-end" to move directly to frontend file using terminal
   b. "npm install"
   c. "npm start"   this code will automatically start the frontend at local host 3000


# important Note 
   a. I have deployed backend on render  and its URL is commented in config.js filr which is in path "/front-end/src/utils/config.js"
   b. it can be used instead of local host 4000


#   The web app is up and running!! , Enjoy the Song

# In Future you can simply run 

   a. "nodemon" in backend file and
   b. "npm start" in forntend file
